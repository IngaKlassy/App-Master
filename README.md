# App-Master

The application aims to assist aging users who wish to keep their vocabulary “hip” when they are using social media. 
It presents common terminology and slang used by young people on various social media platforms, explaining both the meaning 
of the term as well as its context. The focus on the application is to improve the vocabulary so that users do not feel 
confused when talking with young people, or when using the social media platform.
