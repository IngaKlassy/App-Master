          <h3>Welcome to AppMaster!</h3>
          <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspOn top of the home page you can see the Term of the Day, which is updated daily. Clicking on it will take you to a screen where its full definition is provided. It will also let you know from which app it originated. </p>
         <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBelow the Term of the Day there is a list of app icons. They will take you to the pages which will contain a list of terms with their definitions. Those are the terms which you can potentially encounter while interacting with these apps.</p>
         <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspBelow the list of app icons we kindly ask you to rate our app.</p>
         <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspClicking on Glossary tab at the very bottom will take you to a complete list of all the terms available. At the end of the definition of each term there is a link to a specific app page to which this term is related to. You can follow this link to see other terms from that specific app all in one place. </p>
         <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspFor your convinience, at the bottom of the Glossary we provided the list of apps again.</p>
         <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIf you can't find a particular term, you can always let us know by submitting it into the form at the very bottom of the Glossary, and our experts will try to do their best to define it and add it to the database. </p>
